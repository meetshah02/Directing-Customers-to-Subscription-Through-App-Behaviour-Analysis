**Project Structure**

Main Notebook.ipynb file contains all the main code for this project which is also in html and pdf format. Open any of those if you want to read my work.

There is .pptx file which contains Project Presentation.

You will also find three separate data files containing our data. All of them are labelled as 'appdata10.csv' 'new_appdata10.csv' & 'top_screens.csv' respectively.

As you can see, unlike my some projects, there is no REPORT in this one. The reason is that this is a business problem. Here I classified users for a business need.

Finally there is a README file which you are reading right now.ðŸ“–
